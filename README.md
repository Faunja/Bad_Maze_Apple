This contains only the framework.
To actually watch it, you have to add the frames into the bad apple images folder.
Then you need to run renaming.py to make sure the images are properly named.
Then run the program and wait for it to render out all of the mazes individualy, this took around two hours for me, so be patient.
Dont forget to add the music file, just place it within this folder and make sure its named bad_apple.wav.
After its rendered and you've added the audio file, you can run it once again and just watch.
I used this (https://archive.org/download/bad_apple_is.7z) to get the images and the audio.
